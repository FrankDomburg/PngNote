PngNote is a free, open-source, handwriting note-taking app based on [BOOX SDK](https://github.com/onyx-intl/OnyxAndroidDemo/blob/master/doc/Onyx-Pen-SDK.md).

- Use BOOX SDK: Leverage raw-rendering feature, similar stylus lag to the pre-installed note app.
- Open-source.
- Simple, minimum features: Just pencil, erasure, undo, redo.
- Open data format: Use serial number png files with plain directories. Easy to share data by any folder-sync app. No need to export!
